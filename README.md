test-umd-modules
================

An example repo showing how Marionette objects can be UMD-ified.

#### Getting Started

Don't worry about installing the node dependencies or building the app. Because it's
a version of Marionette that's on a branch, I just bundled the app for you.

Simply open the html files under `./html` in your browser. Look at the console to see it
at work!
