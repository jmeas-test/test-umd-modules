This repository is a quick test to show how [marionettejs/backbone.marionette#1900](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1900) is in working condition.

#### Getting Started

Don't worry about installing the node dependencies or building the app. Because it's
a version of Marionette that's on a branch, I just bundled the app for you.

Simply open the html files under `./html` in your browser. Look at the console to see it
at work!
